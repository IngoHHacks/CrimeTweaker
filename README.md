Hard Time III Crime Tweaker

Are the officers in Hard Time III too strict? Or maybe you want to make the game more challenging? This mod is for you! Crime Tweaker allows you to change the probability of crimes being witnessed. You can even change the probability of each crime individually, and also the probability of AI characters being witnessed committing crimes.

## How to use
Just go to the `CrimeTweaker` tab in the `Mods` tab in the options screen and change the values to your liking. The values are in percentage. 100% means the normal probability, 200% means twice the normal probability, 50% means half the normal probability, and so on. All values are additive. If the base probability and star probability are both 200%, the final probability will be 400%. Setting the probability to 0% will make the crime impossible to be witnessed.
